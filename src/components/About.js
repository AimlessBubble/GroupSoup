          GroupSoup was born out of a simple yet frustrating experience. When I, Zevez, first moved to Rochester, I was eager to find a spoken-word poetry group that met in person. I assumed it would be easy with a metro area of over a million people, but I was wrong. It took me eight hours of searching across Facebook Groups and other platforms just to find one in-person group that matched what I was looking for.

          That’s where GroupSoup comes in—a fresh take on modern social media that bridges the gap between online connections and real-life communities. Instead of endless scrolling, our platform makes it effortless to discover, join, and engage with local groups, clubs, and teams that may already exist—like the spoken-word group that I searched for!

          When users open the app, they’ll see an interactive map highlighting nearby groups tailored to their interests, which will be a part of our onboarding experience. If they are searching for something outside their usual interests, they can update and add changes to what they initially answered or remove filters from their search. And when it’s time to meet, GroupSoup encourages deeper social interactions by offering an optional feature that temporarily disables non-essential apps (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) upon check-in—helping users stay present and engaged rather than resorting to awkward phone scrolling.

          To ensure safe and structured in-person gatherings, all groups on the platform collaborate with GroupSoup hubs or partnered small businesses—places like public libraries, coffee shops, and family-run restaurants. For businesses, this means more foot traffic, longer customer stays, and increased online visibility through Google reviews and word-of-mouth promotion. To help GroupSoup stay relevant after the first meet-up, we will have a sticker on the door where you'll typically see GrubHub or DoorDash stickers. Additionally, if businesses have the space, we will have a board that helps new people discover the platform and the events at that specific GroupSoup hub. This board could be a physical calendar or an interactive kiosk that draws new people into a world bustling with community.

          At its core, GroupSoup isn’t just about meeting new people—it’s about rediscovering your city, exploring new hobbies, and fostering real, meaningful connections. The digital world has made it easy to connect, but we’re here to ensure those connections happen in the real world, too.

          Are you ready to stir up something new? Let’s build stronger communities—one group at a time.
